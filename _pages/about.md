Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning (ML) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the co-supervision of Professor Mohamed-Slim Alouini (KAUST) and Professor Vaneet Aggarwal (Purdue University). I am interested in ML, mainly reinforcement learning and deep learning. 

I have studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Sfax and have been among the top 1% in the Tunisian national contest of Mathematics and Physics in 2017. In 2020, I received my Diplôme d’Ingénieur with first-class honors in Multidisciplinary Engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie. In 2022, I received my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KAUST.
