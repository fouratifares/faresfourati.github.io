Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in machine learning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), within the [CEMSE](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/) division, co-advised by Prof. [Mohamed-Slim Alouini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HqIyyXcAAAAJ&hl=en) from KAUST and Prof. [Vaneet Aggarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tu4lmGwAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). 

My research centers around multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, and neural networks, with a commitment to exploring intelligence and contributing to the advancement of AI.

In 2022, I obtained my M.Sc. in electrical and computer engineering from KAUST. In 2020, I earned my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in multidisciplinary engineering from the [Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia_Polytechnic_School), which I joined in 2017 after ranking in the top 1% in the Tunisian national mathematics and physics contest.
