Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the co-supervision of Professor Mohamed-Slim Alouini from KAUST and Professor Vaneet Aggarwal from Purdue University. My research centers around reinforcement learning and deep learning, with a commitment to exploring intelligence and contributing to the advancement of AI.

In 2022, I attained my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KAUST. In 2020, I graduated with first-class honors, earning my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Multidisciplinary Engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie. Earlier, I engaged in the study of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Sfax, achieving a position within the top 1% in the Tunisian national Mathematics and Physics contest of 2017.
