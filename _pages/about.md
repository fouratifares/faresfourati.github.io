Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Machine Learning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the co-supervision of Professor [Mohamed-Slim Alouini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HqIyyXcAAAAJ&hl=en) from KAUST and Professor [Vaneet Aggarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tu4lmGwAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). 

My research centers around multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, with a commitment to exploring intelligence and contributing to the advancement of AI.

In 2022, I attained my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KAUST. In 2020, I earned my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Multidisciplinary Engineering from the [Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia_Polytechnic_School). Earlier, I engaged in the study of Mathematics and Physics at the Sfax Preparatory Engineering Institute, University of Sfax, achieving a position within the top 1% in the Tunisian national Mathematics and Physics contest of 2017.
